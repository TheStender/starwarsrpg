      </div>
      <div class="container mt-1">
        <h3>Session One - March 21, 2024</h3>
        <p>
          The players introduced their characters. They were on the Sith Cruiser
          Inferno, a YG-4210 Light Freighter above the planet of Korriban.
          Participating in the battle against the Republic their ship took heavy
          fire and all of the crew were killed except for the four players.
        </p>

        <p>
          When Jack's character tried to pilot the ship the engines were not
          working. Thom discovered a fire in the engine room and vented the
          atmosphere to put the fire out, which worked.
        </p>

        <p>
          A small Republic ship docked with the Inferno and two Republic
          soldiers boarded but were prompty killed.
        </p>

        <p>
          The players drug all the dead bodies onto the Republic ship, got the
          memory core from it, and detached it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mike's character got a transmission from Lord Vitiate ordering them to
          a set of coordinates. They followed the order and entered hyperspace.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="container mt-1">
        <h3>Session Two - March 28, 2024</h3>
        <p>
          You met with Lord Vishiate who is now in control of the Sith Empire,
          and is planning a strategic retreat to the unknown regions. In order
          to slip away undetected, he has tasked you with destroying a Republic
          sensor array on a nearby planet. You were not his first choice as he
          wanted the Captain of the Inferno, who was killed in the battle of
          Korriban. Since he had no one else he was forced to send you. He sent
          Lord Teris, his fourth in command, with you to assist.
        </p>

        <p>
          You were told of the back door to the array, which was far less
          guarded than the front. Upon recon you found only a handful of guards,
          which you dispatched with ease.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lord Teris planted explosives, and the sensor array was destroyed. You
          returned to the fleet with your mission being a success.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="container mt-1">
        <h3>Session Three - April 4, 2024</h3>
        <p>
          Upon return to the Sith fleet you were instructed to retreive a
          holocron from a ship above Korriban. The ship was rendered inoperable
          and is floating derelict in space.
        </p>

        <p>
          You exited hyperspace far enough from the Republic fleet that was
          still at the planet, and through Chester's piloting ability were able
          to hide behind the ship as it rotated. Chester docked, and you began
          searching the ship.
        </p>

        <p>
          The engine room was searched first, where a crew member was found
          hiding and whimpering for his life, but Elysian put an end to the
          noise by slicing his throat.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your search led you forward on the shift to the cargo bay, where two
          pirates were searching for something. You attacked them and easily
          killed them. The search for the holocron will continue next time...
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="container mt-1">
        <h3>Session Four - April 11, 2024</h3>
        <p>
          You fought your way to the cockpit of the ship. After a quick battle
          with the remaining pirates, Derriphan found the holocron but hid it.
          Leen went with Lord Teris to the cafeteria and found the last
          remaining crew member, who they promptly killed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leen and Lord Teris went to return to the cockpit when Leen shot Teris
          from behind. Other members of the party assisted Leen in killing
          Teris. The players left the ship with the holocron and Derriphan was
          able to access it to begin unlocking its secrets.
        </p>
        <p><strong>You were awarded 20 XP</strong></p>
      </div>
      <div class="container mt-1">
        <h3>Session Five - April 25, 2024</h3>
        <p>
          You all felt like there was no plan and life itself had no meaning.
          Perhaps as if you were being forced into some sort of a transition
          session. Chaos erupted and the universe's creator laughed with glee as
          you turned on each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both Derriphan and Elysian mediated with the holocron. Derriphan
          informed the rest of the players that Lord Kressh himself had tasked
          them with opposing Lord Vitiate as he feared the new Sith leader's
          plan was to destroy all of the Dark Lords using a powerful ritual to
          drain their force essence and use it for himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kressh informed Derriphan of a small set of followers, weak in the
          force, that he could use as he pleased. Also he thinks the third in
          command of the Empire, Lord Villen, might be willing to oppose Vitiate
          if he knew of the plan to drain his force power.
        </p>
        <p>
          You made your way to Etti IV, the capital of the Corporate Sector,
          where Derriphan sold a lightsaber and purchased a droid. The droid
          attempted to pilot the ship off planet, but Chester was able to shut
          him down remotely and take control over the ship. After much arguing
          you set off to meet with the Sith fleet, to meet with Lord Villen and
          compose your course of action from there. The transition session ended
          not with a bang, but with a whimper. At least Thom got some action
          during the game.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="container mt-1">
        <h3>Session Six - May 2, 2024</h3>
        <p>
          You met up with the Sith fleet, and made your way to Lord Vitiate. You
          were straightforward and honest with him, telling him the truth about
          the holocron and your knowledge of his force drain ritual. He said you
          were beneath his notice to be worried about having your force powers
          (for those that have them) being drained. He asked you for help in
          locating a suitable planet for his ritual. He sent you to Lord Villen.
        </p>
        <p>
          You told Lord Villen about Vitiate's plan and Villen agreed he must be
          stopped. He said he would find the planet, but said you should go to
          Nathema where Lord Vitiate has been studying for the past several
          years. His residence there may have clues to the ritual. With both
          knowledge of the ritual and the right planet to work against Vitiate,
          Villen thinks you have a chance to stop him.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will make your way to Nathema, gain entrance to Vitiate's
          residence, and locate the ritual information.
        </p>
        <p><strong>You were awarded 20 XP</strong></p>
      </div>
      <div class="container mt-1">
        <h3>Session Six Point Five - May 9, 2024</h3>
        <p>
          After the other players dropped from the call suddenly and without
          much warning, Chester, the fearless Chadra-Fan pilot, took center
          stage in an adventure that would test not only his piloting skills but
          also his wit and resourcefulness. With a daring grin etched across his
          furry visage, Chester bid his fellow companions aboard the Star Hawk
          farewell, itching for a solo escapade through the cosmos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Setting his course for the bustling metropolis of Nar Shaddaa, the
          notorious smuggler's moon, Chester's nimble ship sliced through the
          star-strewn expanse, its engines humming with anticipation. Upon
          arrival, the neon-lit streets greeted him with a chaotic symphony of
          alien tongues and the tantalizing aroma of exotic spices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eager to immerse himself in the vibrant underworld, Chester navigated
          the labyrinthine alleys with finesse, his diminutive stature allowing
          him to slip past the notice of more cumbersome beings. His sharp
          senses and quick reflexes proved invaluable as he danced through the
          shadows, evading the watchful eyes of local enforcers and cunning
          bounty hunters alike.
        </p>
        <p>
          Embracing the thrill of the unknown, Chester found himself entangled
          in a high-stakes sabacc game within the confines of a smoke-filled
          cantina. With a twinkle in his eye and a sly grin, he charmed his way
          into the game, his adept piloting skills translating seamlessly into
          the art of strategic gambling. Amidst the tension and excitement,
          Chester emerged victorious, his pockets lined with credits and his
          reputation as a daring gambler solidified.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Chester's adventure was far from over. Fuelled by adrenaline and a
          thirst for adventure, he accepted a daring smuggling job that promised
          riches beyond his wildest dreams. Maneuvering his ship through
          treacherous asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of
          Republic patrols, Chester proved himself to be a master of the stars,
          his daring escapades immortalized in the annals of galactic folklore.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the twin suns dipped below the horizon, casting a golden hue across
          the endless expanse, Chester returned to his comrades aboard the Star
          Hawk, his heart ablaze with the thrill of his solo escapade. Though
          his journey had been perilous and fraught with danger, Chester emerged
          triumphant, a testament to the indomitable spirit of the galaxy's
          bravest adventurers.
