        <h3>Session Zero - March 21, 2024</h3>
        <p>
          The players introduced their characters. They were on the Sith Cruiser
          Inferno, a YG-4210 Light Freighter above the planet of Korriban.
          Participating in the battle against the Republic their ship took heavy
          fire and all of the crew were killed except for the four players.
        </p>

        <p>
          When Jack's character tried to pilot the ship the engines were not
          working. Thom discovered a fire in the engine room and vented the
          atmosphere to put the fire out, which worked.
        </p>

        <p>
          A small Republic ship docked with the Inferno and two Republic
          soldiers boarded but were prompty killed.
        </p>

        <p>
          The players drug all the dead bodies onto the Republic ship, got the
          memory core from it, and detached it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mike's character got a transmission from Lord Vitiate ordering them to
          a set of coordinates. They followed the order and entered hyperspace.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="container mt-1">
        <h3>Session One - March 28, 2024</h3>
        <p>
          You met with Lord Vishiate who is now in control of the Sith Empire,
          and is planning a strategic retreat to the unknown regions. In order
          to slip away undetected, he has tasked you with destroying a Republic
          sensor array on a nearby planet. You were not his first choice as he
          wanted the Captain of the Inferno, who was killed in the battle of
          Korriban. Since he had no one else he was forced to send you. He sent
          Lord Teris, his fourth in command, with you to assist.
        </p>

        <p>
          You were told of the back door to the array, which was far less
          guarded than the front. Upon recon you found only a handful of guards,
          which you dispatched with ease.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lord Teris planted explosives, and the sensor array was destroyed. You
          returned to the fleet with your mission being a success.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="container mt-1">
        <h3>Session Two - April 4, 2024</h3>
        <p>
          Upon return to the Sith fleet you were instructed to retreive a
          holocron from a ship above Korriban. The ship was rendered inoperable
          and is floating derelict in space.
        </p>

        <p>
          You exited hyperspace far enough from the Republic fleet that was
          still at the planet, and through Chester's piloting ability were able
          to hide behind the ship as it rotated. Chester docked, and you began
          searching the ship.
        </p>

        <p>
          The engine room was searched first, where a crew member was found
          hiding and whimpering for his life, but Elysian put an end to the
          noise by slicing his throat.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your search led you forward on the shift to the cargo bay, where two
          pirates were searching for something. You attacked them and easily
          killed them. The search for the holocron will continue next time...
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="container mt-1">
        <h3>Session Three - April 11, 2024</h3>
        <p>
          You fought your way to the cockpit of the ship. After a quick battle with the remaining pirates, Derriphan found the holocron but hid it. Leen went with Lord Teris to the cafeteria and found the last remaining crew member, who they promptly killed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leen and Lord Teris went to return to the cockpit when Leen shot Teris from behind. Other members of the party assisted Leen in killing Teris. The players left the ship with the holocron and Derriphan was able to access it to begin unlocking its secrets.
