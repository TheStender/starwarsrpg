          <h3>Session One - March 21, 2024</h3>
          <p>
            The players introduced their characters. They were on the Sith
            Cruiser Inferno, a YG-4210 Light Freighter above the planet of
            Korriban. Participating in the battle against the Republic their
            ship took heavy fire and all of the crew were killed except for the
            four players.
          </p>

          <p>
            When Jack's character tried to pilot the ship the engines were not
            working. Thom discovered a fire in the engine room and vented the
            atmosphere to put the fire out, which worked.
          </p>

          <p>
            A small Republic ship docked with the Inferno and two Republic
            soldiers boarded but were prompty killed.
          </p>

          <p>
            The players drug all the dead bodies onto the Republic ship, got the
            memory core from it, and detached it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mike's character got a transmission from Lord Vitiate ordering them
            to a set of coordinates. They followed the order and entered
            hyperspace.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container mt-1">
          <h3>Session Two - March 28, 2024</h3>
          <p>
            You met with Lord Vishiate who is now in control of the Sith Empire,
            and is planning a strategic retreat to the unknown regions. In order
            to slip away undetected, he has tasked you with destroying a
            Republic sensor array on a nearby planet. You were not his first
            choice as he wanted the Captain of the Inferno, who was killed in
            the battle of Korriban. Since he had no one else he was forced to
            send you. He sent Lord Teris, his fourth in command, with you to
            assist.
          </p>

          <p>
            You were told of the back door to the array, which was far less
            guarded than the front. Upon recon you found only a handful of
            guards, which you dispatched with ease.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lord Teris planted explosives, and the sensor array was destroyed.
            You returned to the fleet with your mission being a success.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container mt-1">
          <h3>Session Three - April 4, 2024</h3>
          <p>
            Upon return to the Sith fleet you were instructed to retreive a
            holocron from a ship above Korriban. The ship was rendered
            inoperable and is floating derelict in space.
          </p>

          <p>
            You exited hyperspace far enough from the Republic fleet that was
            still at the planet, and through Chester's piloting ability were
            able to hide behind the ship as it rotated. Chester docked, and you
            began searching the ship.
          </p>

          <p>
            The engine room was searched first, where a crew member was found
            hiding and whimpering for his life, but Elysian put an end to the
            noise by slicing his throat.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your search led you forward on the shift to the cargo bay, where two
            pirates were searching for something. You attacked them and easily
            killed them. The search for the holocron will continue next time...
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container mt-1">
          <h3>Session Four - April 11, 2024</h3>
          <p>
            You fought your way to the cockpit of the ship. After a quick battle
            with the remaining pirates, Derriphan found the holocron but hid it.
            Leen went with Lord Teris to the cafeteria and found the last
            remaining crew member, who they promptly killed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leen and Lord Teris went to return to the cockpit when Leen shot
            Teris from behind. Other members of the party assisted Leen in
            killing Teris. The players left the ship with the holocron and
            Derriphan was able to access it to begin unlocking its secrets.
          </p>
          <p><strong>You were awarded 20 XP</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div class="container mt-1">
          <h3>Session Five - April 25, 2024</h3>
          <p>
            You all felt like there was no plan and life itself had no meaning.
            Perhaps as if you were being forced into some sort of a transition
            session. Chaos erupted and the universe's creator laughed with glee
            as you turned on each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both Derriphan and Elysian mediated with the holocron. Derriphan
            informed the rest of the players that Lord Kressh himself had tasked
            them with opposing Lord Vitiate as he feared the new Sith leader's
            plan was to destroy all of the Dark Lords using a powerful ritual to
            drain their force essence and use it for himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kressh informed Derriphan of a small set of followers, weak in the
            force, that he could use as he pleased. Also he thinks the third in
            command of the Empire, Lord Villen, might be willing to oppose
            Vitiate if he knew of the plan to drain his force power.
          </p>
          <p>
            You made your way to Etti IV, the capital of the Corporate Sector,
            where Derriphan sold a lightsaber and purchased a droid. The droid
            attempted to pilot the ship off planet, but Chester was able to shut
            him down remotely and take control over the ship. After much arguing
            you set off to meet with the Sith fleet, to meet with Lord Villen
            and compose your course of action from there. The transition session
            ended not with a bang, but with a whimper. At least Thom got some
            action during the game.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container mt-1">
          <h3>Session Six - May 2, 2024</h3>
          <p>
            You met up with the Sith fleet, and made your way to Lord Vitiate.
            You were straightforward and honest with him, telling him the truth
            about the holocron and your knowledge of his force drain ritual. He
            said you were beneath his notice to be worried about having your
            force powers (for those that have them) being drained. He asked you
            for help in locating a suitable planet for his ritual. He sent you
            to Lord Villen.
          </p>
          <p>
            You told Lord Villen about Vitiate's plan and Villen agreed he must
            be stopped. He said he would find the planet, but said you should go
            to Nathema where Lord Vitiate has been studying for the past several
            years. His residence there may have clues to the ritual. With both
            knowledge of the ritual and the right planet to work against
            Vitiate, Villen thinks you have a chance to stop him.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will make your way to Nathema, gain entrance to Vitiate's
            residence, and locate the ritual information.
          </p>
          <p><strong>You were awarded 20 XP</strong></p>

        <div class="container mt-1">
          <h3>Session Six Point Five - May 9, 2024</h3>
          <p>
            After the other players dropped from the call suddenly and without
            much warning, Chester, the fearless Chadra-Fan pilot, took center
            stage in an adventure that would test not only his piloting skills
            but also his wit and resourcefulness. With a daring grin etched
            across his furry visage, Chester bid his fellow companions aboard
            the Star Hawk farewell, itching for a solo escapade through the
            cosmos.
          </p>
          <p>
            Setting his course for the bustling metropolis of Nar Shaddaa, the
            notorious smuggler's moon, Chester's nimble ship sliced through the
            star-strewn expanse, its engines humming with anticipation. Upon
            arrival, the neon-lit streets greeted him with a chaotic symphony of
            alien tongues and the tantalizing aroma of exotic spices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eager to immerse himself in the vibrant underworld, Chester
            navigated the labyrinthine alleys with finesse, his diminutive
            stature allowing him to slip past the notice of more cumbersome
            beings. His sharp senses and quick reflexes proved invaluable as he
            danced through the shadows, evading the watchful eyes of local
            enforcers and cunning bounty hunters alike.
          </p>
          <p>
            Embracing the thrill of the unknown, Chester found himself entangled
            in a high-stakes sabacc game within the confines of a smoke-filled
            cantina. With a twinkle in his eye and a sly grin, he charmed his
            way into the game, his adept piloting skills translating seamlessly
            into the art of strategic gambling. Amidst the tension and
            excitement, Chester emerged victorious, his pockets lined with
            credits and his reputation as a daring gambler solidified.
          </p>
          <p>
            But Chester's adventure was far from over. Fuelled by adrenaline and
            a thirst for adventure, he accepted a daring smuggling job that
            promised riches beyond his wildest dreams. Maneuvering his ship
            through treacherous asteroid fields and evading the relentless
            pursuit of Republic patrols, Chester proved himself to be a master
            of the stars, his daring escapades immortalized in the annals of
            galactic folklore.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the twin suns dipped below the horizon, casting a golden hue
            across the endless expanse, Chester returned to his comrades aboard
            the Star Hawk, his heart ablaze with the thrill of his solo
            escapade. Though his journey had been perilous and fraught with
            danger, Chester emerged triumphant, a testament to the indomitable
            spirit of the galaxy's bravest adventurers.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container mt-1">
          <h3>Session Seven - May 16, 2024</h3>
          <p>
            You arrived at the private residence of Lord Vitiate, located on the
            planet Nathema. Setting your ship down under the guise of an
            inspection you were able to meet with Sir Vant, the manor's main
            servant. He gave you a quick tour of the mansion, but said the study
            was off limits to anyone but Lord Vitiate.
          </p>
          <p>
            You had Vant start on a dinner that would include yourselves, the
            Duke in charge of the manor, and a Sith Inquisitor who was staying
            at the mansion. While he began preparing the meal, Chester and
            Elysian broke into the study, setting off an alarm. Leen, who had
            climbed to the roof, saw two troopers and then a speeder rapidly
            approaching the manor. Leen shot at the speeder driver, forcing him
            to crash. The dark-robed figure began walking slowly towards the
            manor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two troopers entered the gallery and began combat with Chester and
            Elysian. Leen dropped down from the roof behind the Inquisitor,
            while Derriphan entered the gallery. The group made quick work of
            the three, killing the two troopers and rendering the Inquisitor
            unconcious. After some sidetracking of a dinner, the group decided
            to grab a scroll that Elysian had seen in the study before closing
            it. Derriphan confirmed it looked like the ritual information and
            the group left the planet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arriving at Drommund Kaas, Lord Villen met with the group. After a
            quick study of the scroll he thought he would be able to counter
            Vitiate's ritual. You headed to the surface where in a large
            ampitheater area thousands of Sith had already gathered to hear a
            speech from Vitiate, who stood on a central platform. Leen climbed
            to the top of a nearby cliff.
          </p>
          <p>
            The group appraoched Vitiate, and Leen fired on Villen. Villen took
            that opportunity to get close to Vitiate and began countering the
            ritual. Vitiate completed the ritual and a force bubble appeared
            around the platform, and all the Sith audience members seemed to go
            comatose. Villen collapsed, and Vitiate attacked the group. Weakened
            by Villen's counter he was not able to bring his full power against
            the group, but was able to defeat them with a small help from Leen
            who was able to penetrate the force bubble and fire on Chester. One
            by one the group fell from Vitiate's attacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            As one of his final actions, Elysian armed a thermal detonator. As
            Leen climbed back onto the cliff, he saw an explosion consume the
            bubble. It collapased in on itself, and when it dissipated there was
            no trace of anything on the platform. No damage from the explosion
            or body parts. Leen watched as the thousands of Sith collapsed as
            they all died together.
          </p>
          <p>
            What happened inside the bubble? Were the occupants vaporized by the
            thermal detonation? Why was the ritual seemingly completed as the
            force users all died as one? Leen can think about those questions as
            he grabs a ship and heads offworld.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Sith Empire is now without a leader, and thousands of their members lay dead on the surface of Drommund Kaas. Only one survivor remains to tell the tale, but will he speak of it, or forever keep the knowledge of what happened to himself?
